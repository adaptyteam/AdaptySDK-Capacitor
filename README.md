Adapty SDK is an open-source framework that makes implementing in-app subscriptions for Capacitor fast and easy. It's 100% open-source and lightweight.

## Why Adapty?

- [No server code implementation](https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-capacitor?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Integrate in-app purchases with server-side receipt validation in minutes — in your own paywall or one created in the no-code builder.
- [No-code paywall builder](https://adapty.io/docs/adapty-paywall-builder?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Create a beautiful, natively rendered paywall in the no-code editor and display it in your app to start getting paid instantly.
- [On-the-fly paywalls price testing](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/ab-tests?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Test different prices, duration, offers, messages, and designs simultaneously, all without new app releases.
- [Beautiful onboardings](https://adapty.io/docs/onboardings?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Design onboardings in the no-code editor and guide users through their first app experience.
- [Full customer's payment history](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/profiles-crm?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Explore the user's payment events from the trial start to subscription cancellation or billing issues.
- [3rd-party integrations](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/events?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Send subscription events to 3rd-party analytics, attribution, and ad services with no coding, even if the user uninstalls the app.
- [Advanced analytics](https://docs.adapty.io/v3.0/docs/charts?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Analyze your app real-time metrics with advanced filters, such as Ad network, Ad campaign, country, A/B test, etc.

![No-code builder](https://adapty.io/assets/uploads/2024/09/img-builder-and-templates@2x.webp)

With Adapty, you can create a complete, purchase-ready paywall in the no-code builder.

Adapty automatically renders it and handles all the complex purchase flow, receipt validation, and subscription management behind the scenes.

## Test paywalls & prices on Capacitor without app releases

- Optimize in-app subscriptions with the paywall A/B testing. Conversions, trials, revenue, cancellations, and more — everything is calculated for you: each paywall and each A/B test.
- Change images, colors, layouts, and literally anything using the no-code builder or a custom JSON. Configure different prices, trial periods, promo offers, and more in Adapty without app releases.

## Real-time analytics for your Capacitor app

- Manage the subscription's state without managing transactions.
- 99.5% accuracy.
- View and analyze data by attributes, such as status, channels, campaigns, and more.
- Filter, group, and measure metrics by attribution, platform, custom users' segments, and more in a few clicks.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install @adapty/capacitor
npx cap sync
```

Follow our [quickstart guide](https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-capacitor/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor) to install and configure Adapty SDK. Set up purchases in hours instead of weeks :rocket:

### Platform Support

Adapty SDK for Capacitor is fully supported on **iOS** and **Android** platforms. Web platform is not supported—the build will succeed, but SDK methods will throw `CapacitorException` instead of performing actual operations.

## Examples

We provide example applications demonstrating Adapty SDK integration:

- **Basic Examples** (**React**, **Angular**, **Vue**) - Minimal applications showing core SDK functionality (activation, paywalls, purchases). Perfect for getting started and understanding the basic integration flow.

- **Adapty Devtools** - Advanced development tool for bug reports and SDK testing. This comprehensive example includes detailed logging, debug panels, and testing utilities for developers working on SDK integration or reporting issues.
