Adapty SDK is an open-source framework that makes implementing in-app subscriptions for Capacitor fast and easy. It's 100% open-source and lightweight.

## Why Adapty?

- [No-code paywall builder](https://adapty.io/paywall-builder/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Create and edit conversion-optimized paywalls in minutes with native-rendered UI (not WebView). Apply changes in real-time without app releases.
- [On-the-fly paywalls price testing](https://adapty.io/docs/ab-tests/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Test different prices, duration, offers, messages, and designs simultaneously, all without new app releases.
- [Full customer's payment history](https://adapty.io/docs/profiles-crm/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Explore the user's payment events from the trial start to subscription cancellation or billing issues.
- [In-app purchase data integration](https://adapty.io/docs/event-feed/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Send subscription events to 3rd-party analytics, attribution, and ad services with no coding, even if the user uninstalls the app.
- [Advanced analytics](https://adapty.io/docs/analytics-charts/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor). Analyze your app real-time metrics with advanced filters, such as Ad network, Ad campaign, country, A/B test, etc.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install @adapty/capacitor
npx cap sync
```

Read the [documentation](https://adapty.io/docs/sdk-installation-capacitor/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=AdaptySDK-Capacitor) to install and configure Adapty SDK. Set up purchases in hours instead of weeks :rocket:

### Platform Support

Adapty SDK for Capacitor is fully supported on **iOS** and **Android** platforms. Web platform is not supported—the build will succeed, but SDK methods will throw `CapacitorException` instead of performing actual operations.

## Examples

We provide example applications demonstrating Adapty SDK integration:

- **Basic Examples** (**React**, **Angular**, **Vue**) - Minimal applications showing core SDK functionality (activation, paywalls, purchases). Perfect for getting started and understanding the basic integration flow.

- **Adapty Devtools** - Advanced development tool for bug reports and SDK testing. This comprehensive example includes detailed logging, debug panels, and testing utilities for developers working on SDK integration or reporting issues.
